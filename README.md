# Seatify-Theatre Ticket Booking Console Application
This is a Java-based console application designed as a B2B (Business-to-Business) solution for theatre management. It allows theatre operators to efficiently manage daily operations such as adding movies, scheduling shows, booking and managing tickets, and logging out at the end of the day. With features like show listing, seat availability, and ticket confirmation, this project demonstrates practical use of object-oriented programming in Java and serves as a solid foundation for building real-world management systems.
